# NS Lab 2: Symmetric Key Encryption and Message Digest

The starter code provided to you is written in Python. You need at least <span style="color:#f7007f;"><b>Python 3.10</b></span> to complete this assignment and the [`cryptography`](https://pypi.org/project/cryptography/) module. We will use the Python `cryptography` module to write our program instead of implementing 3DES, RSA and SHA-256 directly. You will also need this module for your Programming Assignment 2, so take this lab as a precursor to the asssignment.
